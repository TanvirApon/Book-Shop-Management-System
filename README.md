- Normalized Database (2NF): Design and implement a normalized database schema (2nd Normal Form) to store and manage the data efficiently.

- Desktop-based App: The application should be developed as a desktop-based application, allowing users to interact with it through a graphical user interface (GUI).

- Use of Properties: Utilize properties in the code to encapsulate and manage data securely.

- Proper Form Validation: Implement proper form validation to ensure the correctness and integrity of the entered data.

- Search Option: Provide a search option that allows all users to search for books or other relevant information within the application.

- OOP Principles: Apply object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to design and develop the application.

- Form Design: Create visually appealing and user-friendly forms with appropriate layouts and controls.

- Proper Use of Access Modifiers: Utilize access modifiers (public, private, protected) effectively to control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

- Database CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage book and user information in the database.

- All Forms Connected: Ensure that all forms in the application are properly connected and interact with each other seamlessly.

- Login Form: The login form should only require the user's ID and password for authentication.
